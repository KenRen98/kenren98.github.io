Three models were tested: YOLOv7, VGG-16, and GoogleNet. GoogleNet was found to be the most effective with an accuracy rate of 94% and faster training speed. The findings can be applied to reduce costs in recycling plants and create garbage collecting mini robots.\n\n#### Introduction\nThe project explores the challenges of image classification and how transfer learning using pre-trained models like CNNs can overcome these challenges. The study focuses on recyclables and assumes that recycling plants have techniques to isolate each piece of recyclable and capture images.\n\n#### Methodology\n- **Models Used:** YOLOv7, VGG-16, and GoogleNet.\n- **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset for recyclables.\n- **Design & Training Pipeline:** Pre-trained VGG-16 and GoogleNet models implemented in PyTorch. YOLOv7 used for object detection.

GoogleNet was concluded as the better model for this task.\n- **Future Directions:** Further testing on various datasets and exploring other areas like facial or shape recognition.\n- **Peer Evaluation:** Feedback received and changes made to improve the report.\n\n#### Updated YOLO V8 and latest model\nThe project has been updated to use the latest YOLO V8, which enhances the performance and efficiency of the models.

The project involved the integration and customization of several technologies, including WHMCS, HTML, CSS, Stripe, and the Pterodactyl panel, to deliver a fully automated system. This system is meticulously designed to alleviate the challenges associated with game server setup and customization, notably modding and adjusting game values.\n![Home Page](home.png)\n\n### Design and Development\n\nLeveraging the Hostie template, I meticulously customized HTML pages to resonate with the aesthetic and functional expectations of our target audience. This customization extended to WHMCS pages, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience. Every design decision was taken with the user in mind, aiming to provide premium servers that are not only high in quality but also accessible in their native language.\n\n### Integration and Automation\n\nOne of the cornerstone features of this project was the seamless integration of Stripe for LINK payment, including Apple Pay. This integration underscores our commitment to offering convenient and secure payment options, catering to the preferences of our users. Furthermore, the incorporation of the Pterodactyl panel into our system marked a significant advancement in our capability to offer fully automated game server rentals.\n![Automation](automation.png)\n\n### Localization and Accessibility\n\nRecognizing the importance of cultural and linguistic accessibility, all HTML and WHMCS pages were localized. This initiative was undertaken to ensure that our services are not just available but also approachable and easy to use for the overseas Chinese community.

The project involved the integration and customization of several technologies, including WHMCS, HTML, CSS, Stripe, and the Pterodactyl panel, to deliver a fully automated system. This system is meticulously designed to alleviate the challenges associated with game server setup and customization, notably modding and adjusting game values.\n![Home Page](home.png)\n\n### Design and Development\n\nLeveraging the Hostie template, I meticulously customized HTML pages to resonate with the aesthetic and functional expectations of our target audience. This customization extended to WHMCS pages, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user experience. Every design decision was taken with the user in mind, aiming to provide premium servers that are not only high in quality but also accessible in their native language.\n\n### Integration and Automation\n\nOne of the cornerstone features of this project was the seamless integration of Stripe for LINK payment, including Apple Pay. This integration underscores our commitment to offering convenient and secure payment options, catering to the preferences of our users. Furthermore, the incorporation of the Pterodactyl panel into our system marked a significant advancement in our capability to offer fully automated game server rentals.\n![Automation](automation.png)\n\n### Localization and Accessibility\n\nRecognizing the importance of cultural and linguistic accessibility, all HTML and WHMCS pages were localized.
