## Introduction

We have integrated the Pterodactyl panel for these new nodes, a move that streamlines management and operations while enhancing automation capabilities.
I also participates in the egg (Docker image and Installation scripts) developement of Pterodactyl in the major open source repositories.

[My Github Page](https://github.com/KenRen98).

## Technical Design

### Architecture:
   - **Distributed System:** The nodes are part of a distributed system that ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
   - **Microservices:** The system is built using a microservices architecture, allowing for scalability and ease of maintenance.

### Containerization with Docker:
   - **Isolation:** Docker containers encapsulate each game server, ensuring isolation and consistent environments.
   - **Docker Compose:** Used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, simplifying deployment.

### Pterodactyl Panel:
   - **Integration:** The panel is integrated with the Docker ecosystem, providing a unified interface for managing game servers.
   - **Customization:** Allows for extensive customization of server settings and configurations.

### Security:
   - **MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using the Google Authenticator app enhances security.
   - **Firewalls & Network Isolation:** Implementation of firewalls and network segmentation to protect sensitive data.

### Automation & Monitoring:
   - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - **Monitoring Tools:** Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time insights.

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup:
   - **Development, Staging, and Production Environments:** Ensuring a smooth transition from development to production.

### Scalability:
   - **Horizontal Scaling:** Ability to add or remove nodes based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

### Backup & Recovery:
   - **Regular Backups:** Scheduled backups of critical data.
   - **Disaster Recovery Plan:** A robust plan to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failure.
